# Sentiment_Analysis_App
This project is a sentiment analysis application developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" dataset from Kaggle. Additionally, a simple user interface has been created to interact with the model.

*Introduction/n
This project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets using a CNN model. The sentiments are typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes both the model training and a basic interface for sentiment analysis.

*Dataset/n
The dataset used for this project is the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a large number of tweets labeled with their respective sentiments.
