# Sentiment_Analysis_App
This project is a sentiment analysis application developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" dataset from Kaggle. Additionally, a simple user interface has been created to interact with the model.

*Introduction
This project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets using a CNN model. The sentiments are typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes both the model training and a basic interface for sentiment analysis.

*Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a large number of tweets labeled with their respective sentiments.

*Model 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was chosen to leverage its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data, which is particularly useful in text data for identifying patterns and features. The model was trained using the Kaggle dataset.

*Interface
A simple user interface has been developed to allow users to input tweets and receive sentiment analysis results in real-time. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
